# SQLCodeSmells
The ASCIIDOCS version of the book. There are now 240 code smells. The smells have been added to to ensure that all the 'smells' that are well-known and accepted in the industry are included.
The contents of the SQL Code Smells book is stored here in the hope that other collaborators will help by working on it. It is in pdf, ebook, Word and html to assist with viewing the book, but the only document that should be edited is the asccidoc source. Collaborators are able to edit this within github.
